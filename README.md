## Some context about this skill assessment.

Why do we do this skill assessment? How should it be approached? Please consider the following:

### 1. It's a conversation starter.

The purpose of this skill assessment is to create a discussion framework when you come in for the techical interview. This leads to a much more meaningful conversations about a potential technical match, for you and for Thinkmill.

### 2. It's okay if you struggle and can't complete the challenge.

This skill assessment is meant to be challenging, and push you out of your comfort zone. You might not be able to complete it, and that's okay. This doesn't mean you're disqualified!

If you feel like you couldn't showcase your real skills, perhaps you can find a way to let them shine! You love accessibility? Unit tests? You're welcome to add those, or anything that you think could improve the app and let you show us what you're good at.

### 3. Treat it like a mini "real work"/"remote work" situation.

We want this skill assessment to be as close to "real life" as possible. We want it to feel like you're working with us. Always keep that in mind.

It's ok to ask questions. Actually, it's encouraged to reach out if you're struggling. It gives us a chance to get a feel for your collaboration and communication skills :)

The best way to ask a question is to send an email to the person you interviewed with prior to this skill assessment.

Good luck! ðŸ¤ž
